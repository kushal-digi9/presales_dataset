We’re a small startup with just 3 sales reps—would VoizPanda be overkill for us?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThanks for reaching out! Even small teams can benefit from AI. To better assess fit: are you doing high-volume cold outreach, or more relationship-based calls?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWe’re doing about 200 calls per rep per day—mostly cold outreach to SMBs.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThat’s actually perfect for our Starter tier—it includes predictive dialing and real-time sentiment cues. Do you have any compliance needs, like call recording for legal purposes?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYes, we need to record every call and store it for 7 years due to financial regulations.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nUnderstood. The Starter tier includes 1-year retention, but for 7 years, you’d need our Pro tier with archival compliance. Is budget approval already secured for this?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWe have a $3K/month ceiling. Is that enough for Pro?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPro starts at $2,800/month for your team size and includes the 7-year archival.

We need deep integration with our existing Salesforce instance.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOur Enterprise tier offers bi-directional Salesforce sync with custom object mapping. Do you require guaranteed uptime or have a dedicated IT security team that would need isolated infrastructure?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYes—we’re under contract to guarantee 99.99% uptime and must host data in the EU only.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThat confirms you need our Enterprise tier, which includes a dedicated EU cloud instance and SLA-backed uptime.
