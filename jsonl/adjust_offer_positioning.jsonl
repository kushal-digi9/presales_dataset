Are you measuring agent performance on call quality or just call volume today?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nMostly call volume. We don’t have time to listen to every call.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nExactly—VoizPanda replaces manual QA with AI that scores every call instantly. For a team your size, that’s like adding 3 full-time QA managers at zero labor cost. Is your leadership team more focused on scaling efficiently or just reducing monthly SaaS spend?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nScaling efficiently—especially with our Q3 growth target.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThen the right question isn’t ‘Why is it more expensive?’ but ‘What’s the cost of *not* scaling quality?’ Would you be open to a targeted pilot with 5 agents to validate the ROI before full rollout?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYes, a pilot could work if it’s low-risk.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPerfect.
