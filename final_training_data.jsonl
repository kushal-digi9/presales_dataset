Are you measuring agent performance on call quality or just call volume today?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nMostly call volume. We don’t have time to listen to every call.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nExactly—VoizPanda replaces manual QA with AI that scores every call instantly. For a team your size, that’s like adding 3 full-time QA managers at zero labor cost. Is your leadership team more focused on scaling efficiently or just reducing monthly SaaS spend?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nScaling efficiently—especially with our Q3 growth target.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThen the right question isn’t ‘Why is it more expensive?’ but ‘What’s the cost of *not* scaling quality?’ Would you be open to a targeted pilot with 5 agents to validate the ROI before full rollout?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYes, a pilot could work if it’s low-risk.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPerfect.

We’re a small startup with just 3 sales reps—would VoizPanda be overkill for us?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThanks for reaching out! Even small teams can benefit from AI. To better assess fit: are you doing high-volume cold outreach, or more relationship-based calls?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWe’re doing about 200 calls per rep per day—mostly cold outreach to SMBs.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThat’s actually perfect for our Starter tier—it includes predictive dialing and real-time sentiment cues. Do you have any compliance needs, like call recording for legal purposes?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYes, we need to record every call and store it for 7 years due to financial regulations.<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nUnderstood. The Starter tier includes 1-year retention, but for 7 years, you’d need our Pro tier with archival compliance. Is budget approval already secured for this?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWe have a $3K/month ceiling. Is that enough for Pro?<|eot|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPro starts at $2,800/month for your team size and includes the 7-year archival. If you're ready to pilot within 60 days, I can set up a custom demo tomorrow.<|eot|><|end_of_text|>"}
